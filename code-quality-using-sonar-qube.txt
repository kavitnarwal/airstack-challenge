Installing SonarQube
You can install SonarQube in multiple ways and you can visit the below page to install based on your operating system.

https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/
I used Docker to install SonarQube on my local machine. Make sure you install the latest Docker Desktop from this page.

https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
You need to run the following command to start the SonarQube on port 9000.

docker run -d --name sonarqube -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest

You can list the docker container using docker ps command. 

Once started and you can hit the URL http://localhost:9000/


SonarQube
Running Analysis
First, we need to create a project in the SonarQube. Click on the Manually tab. 


Creating a project
Let’s give the project display name and the key. 


Display Name and Key
On the next screen, you need to let SonarQube know where you want it to analyze the repository. Let’s select Locally.

You need to generate the token.

Once you go to the next screen you need to select the build. Since we are running analysis on the NodeJS API with configuration, let’ select Other.


Selecting the right tool
You need to download scanner before running this command. Let’s download the scanner based on your operating system.


Downloading Scanner
You should add the path of the above downloaded sonar-scanner bin folder to the PATH. Let’s open /etc/paths with the following command and add the variable.

sudo vi /etc/paths
Once done, you can run the following command from the Sonar page.

sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=todoapp \
  -Dsonar.sources=. \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=3a874f9b17b1ffcd16e4ffda51f3ae0454d9f046
Let’s copy the command and run it at the root of the above-cloned project as below.


Running the command
When the build is successful, you can see the SonarQube screen automatically refreshed with the analysis.
